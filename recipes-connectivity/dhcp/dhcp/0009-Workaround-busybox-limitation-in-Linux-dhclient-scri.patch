Subject: [PATCH] Workaround busybox limitation in Linux dhclient-script

Busybox is a lightweight implementation of coreutils commonly used on
space-constrained embedded Linux distributions. It's implementation of
chown and chmod doesn't provide a "--reference" option added to
client/scripts/linux as of commit 9261cb14. This change works around
that limitation by using stat to read ownership and permissions flags
and simple chown/chmod calls supported in both coreutils and busybox.
