wr-deprecated
=======

This layer provides "deprecated" components for Wind River Linux. Because 
upstream Yocto project will likely remove support on certain features without 
notification, we will have to move these features to this layer to continue 
shipping them so that the users will be able to have time to transition to the 
replacement functionalities.

These removed features can be built and parked within WRLinux before removing 
them completely in 3-6 months.


Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on the openembedded-core.


Maintenance
-----------
This layer is maintained by Wind River Systems, Inc.
Contact <support@windriver.com> or your support representative for more

Building the wr-deprecated layer
